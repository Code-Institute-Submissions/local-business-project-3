        2. You can jump easily into registering from either the navbar or from one of the category explanation boxes.
        3. Even if you are already logged in you can simply click under the category explanations to go straight to a request.

        1. The navbar has everything needed to navigate through the website.
        2. Thanks to the search feature, it's easy to find specific jobs, locations and categories.

        1. It's easy to use the search feature and using key words and locations can really help.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I will have different requests for different categories.

        1. Requesting more than 1 job is nice as I can request multiple jobs for different aspects in my life.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added requests that match my local business.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily check for new requests and comments.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to help out others and leave a comment to help them find what they are looking for.
